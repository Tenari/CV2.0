lists the groundcode for each visible tile. If the player is at the edge of the map, groundCode will be 0 for out of range spots.

DirectionCodes: 1= north. 2= south. 3= east. 4= west.
"v [for each tile: [groundCode] [[directionCode] [classCode] if organism on spot] -1]"
ex: "v 0 -1 0 -1 0 -1 0 -1 1 -1 2 2 500 -1 ...."will always have 11X11 "-1"s
